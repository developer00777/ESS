/**
 * Builds the reporting hierarchy from flat user rows.
 *
 * Deliberately DB-free so it unit-tests directly, the same way the spreadsheet
 * parsers do. The route hands it plain rows; it hands back trees.
 *
 * The hard requirement is that nobody disappears. `users.reports_to` is NULL
 * for most accounts today, points outside the set whenever the caller filters
 * to one team, and — if a row were ever written directly to the database —
 * could close a loop. Each of those is a shape this has to render, not an
 * error case: an org chart that silently drops the people it cannot place is
 * worse than no org chart, because nothing tells you they are missing.

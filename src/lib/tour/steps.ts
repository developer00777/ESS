/**
 * The guided tour: one walk through the portal, page by page, pointing at
 * the parts people use. ProductTour (src/lib/components/tour) plays it.
 *
 * Targets are `[data-tour="…"]` anchors placed on the elements themselves
 * (PageHeader carries page / page-tabs / page-actions for every page). A
 * step whose target isn't on screen is shown in the middle instead, or
 * skipped when it is `optional`, so a missing anchor never stalls the tour.

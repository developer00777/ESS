/**
 * Policy-driven leave balances (see "leave polcies.pdf", published through
 * Admin → Publish Policies into leave_types).
 *
 * Balances are ACCRUED, not granted up front: every accrual-based type
 * credits its `accrualPerMonth` once per month, January (or the joining
 * month) through the current month. Types marked `post_probation` (Earned
 * Leave) start at the confirmation month instead; someone whose confirmation
 * hasn't happened yet accrues nothing on those. Event-based types
 * (maternity/paternity/bereavement — `fixedDays`, no accrual) never carry a
 * standing balance, so they get no allocation row.
 *
 * Recomputed idempotently on page loads: allocatedDays is overwritten with
 * the freshly computed figure (usedDays is never touched), so the numbers
 * follow the calendar month with no cron. Employees with no joining or
 * confirmation date on file are treated as long-settled staff and accrue
 * from January — the HR tracker carries these dates, so the gap is rare.
 *
 * Prior years' carry-forward (max 5 days by policy) cannot be derived here —
 * that history lives in HRone, which the portal cannot read. HR supplies those
 * figures through Admin → Leave Balances, and any row they set carries
 * `isHrSet`.
 *
 * An uploaded figure is an OPENING balance, not a closing one. Earned leave
 * goes on accruing on top of it, so an HR-set row is recomputed as its recorded
 * baseline (`hrSetDays`) plus the months elapsed since HR set it — not
 * recomputed from the policy alone, which would throw their figure away, and
 * not frozen, which would stop 1.5 days a month ever landing. Keeping the
 * baseline in its own column is what makes that safe to run on every page load:
 * reading it back out of `allocatedDays` would compound the same month over and
 * over. Rows uploaded before that column existed have no baseline to build on
 * and stay pinned exactly as given.

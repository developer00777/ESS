/**
 * The floor for everything under /admin: anyone holding a privilege that opens
 * an admin tab (src/lib/capabilities.ts) — HR Admins and Super Admins by
 * default, and named roles such as IT Support.
 *
 * Five pages each carried an identical inline copy of this check, which meant
 * a new admin page was one forgotten redirect away from being reachable by an
 * employee. The two pages whose floor this exactly matches (biometric upload,
 * leave balances) now rely on it; the three that are deliberately stricter
 * (data cleanup, publish policies, design tweaks) keep their own Super
 * Admin-only check, because the floor is not the same as their rule.
 *
 * This does not belong in hooks.server.ts: that layer authenticates every
 * request for the whole app, and folding one route subtree's authorisation
 * into it would put the rule at the wrong level and hide it from anyone
 * reading these routes.
 *
 * It also computes what the Admin Controls shell shows on every tab: the
 * attention list, the status dot on each tab and each section's summary.

/**
 * Withdraws a comp-off claim the employee raised themselves.
 *
 * Only while it is still undecided. Once HR has credited it the day is a real
 * balance the employee may already have spent, and once spent it backs a leave
 * application — deleting either would silently take back leave that was granted.
 * A credited comp-off is HR's to reverse, not the claimant's to delete.
 *
 * Deleted rather than marked cancelled: a claim nobody acted on carries no
 * decision worth auditing, and leaving withdrawn rows behind would clutter the
 * employee's own list. The activity log records that it happened.

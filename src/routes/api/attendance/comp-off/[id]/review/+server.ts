/**
 * SOP §1: verify attendance, confirm 7+ hours, then credit the comp-off.
 *
 * Comp-off is a ONE-step approval — the claimant's reporting manager decides and
 * that credits it. The only question is whether the person really worked the
 * day, which the manager is the one placed to answer; there is no HR stage to
 * add. Leave and attendance corrections keep the two-step manager → HR chain.
 *
 * Eligibility is re-checked at decision time rather than trusting the snapshot
 * taken when the employee claimed. A ProHance re-sync between claim and decision
 * can change the worked hours, and crediting a comp-off the record no longer
 * supports is exactly what the verification step is meant to prevent.
